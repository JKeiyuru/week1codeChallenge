DESCRIPTION:
This repository contains three basic javaScript programs:
  1. Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
  2. Speed Detector (Toy Problem)
  3. Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
Each of these programs demonstartes how to build interactive programs in JavaScript by collecting user input
and using logic processing to calculate and display results.

1.Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)
  Description: The Grading Program first allows a user to input the number of subjects necessary, then the user
    inputs the student marks (between 0 and 100) for each of the subjects. The program then calculates the correct 
    grade based on the following rules:
       I.  A: Marks > 79
       II. B: Marks between 60 and 79
       III. C: Marks between 49 and 59
       IV.  D: Marks between 40 and 49
       V.   E: Marks < 40   
      The program also calculates the average (mean) grade across all the provided subjects.

   PROJECT SETUP: 
       1. Clone the repository:
           git clone
